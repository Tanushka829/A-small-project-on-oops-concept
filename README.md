# A-small-project-on-oops-concept
I have just started learning OOPs in python. Here is one simple example.

## How I thought about it
I wanted to  create and store car and car's owner's details by using class and objects.
I used def function to take input from user name and age of owner.
And details of car's like brand name and its price
lastly printed on screen all above.
